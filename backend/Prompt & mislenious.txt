////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

ok, now my project is complete, now it is time to write a complete a report for this project,
till now we have done:
1. DATA COLLECTION: we have written a python program using selenium to download PDFs of contract case judgments from Indiankanoon website using 'data collection using selenium.py'
2. DATASET PREPARATION: we have created datasetcalled 'MANISH.json' in JSON format with 7 perameters using 'DATASET MAKER.py'.
3. FINETUNING & TRAINING AI MODEL USING DATASET AND SAVING TRAINED AI MODEL IN A PKL FILE: we have decided to use 'META/Llama-3.2-1B' model as backbone of our AI model, so we finetuned and trained Llama-3.2-3B with our dataset called 'MANISH.json', and downloaded it in .pkl file for future use, using 'llama training & finetuning program.py' program in google colab notebook.
4. USING TRAINED AI MODEL FROM THAT PKL FILE: we load our finetuned Llama-3.2-3B model as .pkl file in google colab notebook, and created a FastAPI API & ngrok for backend server in 'FInal AI using trained & finetuned llama.py' program
5. TESTING ACCURACY OF AI OUTPUT: we have written a python program to test and evaluevaluate the output or AI generated content using 'Evaluate & test accuracy of AI output.py' program.
6. FRONTEND REACT APP FOR USER INTERACTION & CHATING WITH AI: we have created a React app for chating And interacting with that AI API Ngrok.
